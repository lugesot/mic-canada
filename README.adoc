== edit your host
127.0.0.1       usa.mic.com
127.0.0.1       canada.mic.com

== how run
yarn
yarn dev
browse http://usa.mic.com

== http & port
Make sure use default 80 to jump different Domains successfully.
Make sure you use http instead of https.

== locale trick
Use just three locales of `en-US, en, fr` mapping standard ones as: en-US, en-CA, fr-CA
The regions accordingly are the USA, Canada and Canada.
However the Nextjs framework identify your locale by the domain and prefix. Please try these urls below to feel:
http://usa.mic.com
http://usa.mic.com/en-US
http://canada.mic.com
http://canada.mic.com/en
http://canada.mic.com/fr

== out of scope
Although http://usa.mic.com/en work, it should be redirected to http://usa.mic.com in the product environment.
The same http://usa.mic.ca redirects to http://canada.mic.com, http://usa.mic.ca/fr to http://canada.mic.com/fr.
Else they will confuse us and make troubles.

== 307 problem
Check your prefix and default locale, e.g.: domain.com --> domain.com/fr
Else use middleware custom your prefix the default locale
